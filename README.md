# Optimal rectangulations

This repository implements some algorithms that can be used to optimally
split a rectangle in many, with some definitions of "optimal". For more
detailed information, see the article [How to share your videoconference window among callers â€“ or, the many ways of splitting a rectangle in many](https://www.alfonsobeato.net/uncategorized/the-many-ways-of-splitting-a-rectangle-in-many).

To install the dependencies in an Ubuntu system and run the unit tests
that run the algorithms:

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install python3-pip
$ pip3 install numpy matplotlib scipy sympy
$ ./rect_test.py
```
